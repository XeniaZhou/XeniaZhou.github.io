  <div class="text1">1."I worked as the Panda keeper in Wolong,
  </br>Bifengxia and Hetaoping Panda Breeding Bases in Oct, 2016.
</br>I cleaned Panda Houses, fed pandas and made special Panda
</br>food. I also studied the knowledge of diseases, breeding
</br>data and wild training conditions of pandas. That is an
</br>unforgetable experience."
</br>2."I also join in the group to investigate the living
</br>condition of fish and birds in Jan, 2016 in Cambodia. Through
</br>my skin was burnt under the strong sunshine, I encountered
</br>different kinds of egrets, pelicans and catfishes, recording
</br>their data and photoing them along with the peaceful lake and
</br>gorgeous sunset, which was so meaningful and cheerful for my
</br>heart of exploring nature."

<div class="text2">"When I started shooting my first microfilm,
</br>I knew I needed to make it the best. I spent several days to
</br>convince my classmate who I thought to be the best choice for
</br>the main actor of joining my group -- it was a 'group' with
</br>the only member: me. It was also the first time I became a
</br>leader, recruiting actors and photographers, arrange the
</br>shooting schedule and organize classmates to be the group
</br>actors. Those trivial things I needed to deal with by myself
</br>stimulated me to check the scenes again and again and refilmed
</br>those inperfect fragments. Finally, mine small idea was refined
</br>and finished by the whole class family. This first experience
</br>is sweet."
